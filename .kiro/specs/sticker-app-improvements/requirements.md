# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines improvements to the AI Sticker Maker application, focusing on code optimization, enhanced download functionality, improved UI layout for expressions selection, and adding proper attribution footer.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to download all generated stickers in a organized folder structure so that I can easily manage and use my sticker collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. WHEN download completes THEN the ZIP file SHALL be automatically downloaded to the user's device

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the expressions selection to be presented in a scrollable carousel format so that I have a consistent and intuitive interface similar to the style selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing expressions THEN they SHALL be displayed in a horizontal scrollable carousel
2. WHEN there are more expressions than fit in view THEN navigation arrows SHALL appear
3. WHEN user clicks navigation arrows THEN the carousel SHALL scroll smoothly to show more expressions
4. WHEN expressions are in carousel format THEN they SHALL maintain current selection functionality
5. WHEN custom expressions are added THEN they SHALL appear in the same carousel format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see proper attribution and version information so that I know who created the application and can access related resources.

4. WHEN footer is displayed THEN it SHALL show "Version 1.0.2"
5. WHEN links are clicked THEN they SHALL open in new tabs/windows

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be optimized and maintainable so that future enhancements can be implemented efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is reviewed THEN redundant or unused code SHALL be removed
2. WHEN components are structured THEN they SHALL follow consistent patterns
3. WHEN functions are implemented THEN they SHALL have single responsibilities
4. WHEN styling is applied THEN it SHALL be consistent with the existing design system
5. WHEN performance optimizations are made THEN they SHALL not break existing functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing of new changes and features so that I can ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new features are implemented THEN they SHALL be manually tested for functionality
2. WHEN download functionality is added THEN it SHALL be tested with various sticker counts
3. WHEN carousel navigation is implemented THEN it SHALL be tested on different screen sizes
4. WHEN footer links are added THEN they SHALL be tested to ensure proper navigation
5. WHEN code optimizations are made THEN existing functionality SHALL be regression tested
